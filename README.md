# SkillAlign
A Salesforce-based Skill Alignment and Project Readiness system that matches employees to projects using quantified skills, gap analysis, and role-based workflows.

## Reference & Inspiration

This project was conceptually inspired by Salesforce’s discussion on skill gap analysis and workforce readiness:

- **Salesforce Blog:** *Skills Gap Analysis Template*  
  Salesforce, Inc.  
  https://www.salesforce.com/eu/blog/skills-gap-analysis-template/

The referenced article provided high-level guidance on identifying skill gaps and assessing workforce readiness.  
All Salesforce configuration, data modeling, security design, Lightning UI, and evaluation logic in this project are independently designed and implemented to align with Salesforce Developer Edition constraints and real-world enterprise practices.
